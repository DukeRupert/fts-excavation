        As a child Frank dreamed about operating excavators and bulldozers. Before he was out of
        high school he had signed up with the Marines on one condition- that they train him to
        operate heavy machinery. Frank has over 25 years of experience with heavy equipment
        operation and has done everything on all sorts of large and small machines, from commercial
        work to road work, septic systems, housing developments – you name it!

        Beverly is a stay at home mom and educator. She runs the admin side of the business with a
        team of wonderful people from the community. When she met Frank, their hard-work and
        integrity became synergy, and things started to take off.

        Our goal is to build a company that serves local homeowners and businesses, offering fair
        pricing and quality work. We try to keep the money that is spent by our business within the
        community and the USA as much as possible. We also love Jesus Christ and won’t hide it. We’d
        love to pray with you and encourage you anytime.

      <p>Thank you for considering us for your project and passing along our name.</p>
